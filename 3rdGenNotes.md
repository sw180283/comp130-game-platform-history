#Notes
Here are the notes for the presentation on the 3rd generation consoles.

##Intro

At this point in time, surrounding the start of the 3rd generation of game platforms, there were a vast number of companies attempting to make a profit from the games industry both through the abundance of games consoles and the stream of imitation games.
As the market was flooded with non-regulated games in terms of quality and adult themes/censorship, both the consumer and shop distributor were left confused as to what to buy. In part, this lead to an important turning point for the games industry, as this would either crash the development of new games unless a new dominant product gave direction for the industry.

##sg-1000 - Sam

The sg-1000 was the first home video game console to be released by Sega. Originally coming from an arcade background, Sega decided that their ventures could include home gaming in additional to their arcade machines following the trend of home consoles. For this reason, many of the their games, featured on arcade systems were ported to their home console.

While the design of their console was slim and the company was well known for their arcade game history, there were a number of design flaws that made the sg-1000 a flawed console.
    Firstly, their controller was a hardwired joystick, that received complaints that it’s buttons were not ergonomically positioned and unresponsive. Also, because the first controller was hardwired into the console, it meant that replacing a damaged controller was impossible. However, the second controller was detachable.
    Secondly, their hardware wasn’t much different from the previously released Colecovision and MSX standard. In fact, the CPU, video processor and sound chip were the same as the Colecovision.

Unfortunately, the release of the sg-1000 was the same day as the NES.

While the sg-1000 had little influence in terms of the overall console design, it did show companies what not to do, in terms of controller design, but also started the home console production for Sega. Their outright loss against the NES perhaps motivated Sega to vastly improve their hardware capabilities, their business model, and the feedback from their controllers also influenced their later controllers.

To further my research, I’ll investigate the contribution sg-1000 made to the home console design and also the feedback that Sega received and used to upgrade their later versions of the SG-1000. I have already found a multitude of official dedicated books, stating the historical context for both Sega and the gaming console history, such as Console Wars: Sega, Nintendo, and the Battle That Defined a Generation & Service Games: The Rise and Fall of SEGA: Enhanced Edition.



##NES - Angus

The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) was first released by Nintendo in 1983 and later in North America in 1985.  It was an 8-bit, cartridge based console that succeeded by allowing third party developers to create games whilst making classic original games themselves, such as Super Mario Bros. Donkey Kong, Zelda and Metroid.
 
In terms of Hardware the NES didn't set itself apart from the other third generation consoles, partly by being the first released, but it was innovative when it came to accessories.  The NES featured the Robotic Operating Buddy (R.O.B) which was far ahead of any competitors in technology.  It also had the NES Zapper which allowed an arcade style game of shooting the screen, which is seen in Duck Hunt.
 
It's considered to have completely revitalised the videogames industry after a huge crash in 1983 after 97% of all revenues were lost within the industry. Because of this it developed very slowly in the US, and took over a year before any real progress was made.  However by 1988 the NES was more popular than home computers and dominated the market.

Further research on the NES will be made through Diskin, Patrick. "Nintendo Entertainment System Documentation." Tokyo: Nintendo (2004) and O'Donnell, Casey. "The Nintendo Entertainment System and the 10NES chip: Carving the video game industry in silicon." Games and Culture 6.1 (2011): 83-100.


#The Sega Master System - Alastair
 
The Master System was initially released in Japan as the Sega mark III in 1985, 2 years after the SG-1000. It was later redesigned and renamed the Sega Master System and released in 1987 in Europe. It was being sold for £100 in the UK, which is roughly equivalent to £260 today. At the time it was the most powerful 3rd generation console to be released. It was designed to be a direct competitor to the very popular Nintendo Entertainment System. Although it was seen as unsuccessful because it couldn’t compete with the popularity of the NES and its games, it was still the 2nd best-selling console in the 8-bit era.

This laid the foundation for its successor, the Sega Mega Drive, which was a lot more successful. The master system is also still being produced and is the longest living game console of 26 years as of 2015, due to its popularity in Brazil. In total it sold between 10 and 13 million units. ( 1.7M in Japan, 2M in US, 5M in Brazil, 7M in Europe)

To further my research on the master system, I have found a number of books that reference the console in the library, such as a complete guide to Sega Genesis, Neo Geo and TurboGrafx-16 games, by Weiss, Brett. And The video game explosion : a history from Pong to Playstation and beyond by Wolf, Mark.



 
##Atari 7800 - Thomas

The Atari 7800 was a third generation games console which was released in the year 1986 in the US and 1987 in the EU by the Atari Corporation at a price of $140 in North America. The console came 3 years after it was originally said to be released as the Atari 3600 which was the original concept for the follow up console to Atari’s previous consoles like the 2600 and the 5200. The consoles release did not come to fruition due to sale of the Atari consumer division and due to the console crash of 1983 where the revenues from games fell 97% which raised serious doubts over the games market after bankrupting companies like Atari itself.

When the Atari 7800 was released it came with a range of games like pole position II, Ms. Pac-Man and Centipede and it had backwards compatibility with the Atari 2600 which provided it with lots more games from the previous generation. Atari still struggled however due to strict Nintendo licensing agreements which limited the games Atari had as games made on Nintendo by developers could not be made on competing consoles for two years and due to the NES’s massive success developers often choose to develop for that console. Peripherals that came with the Atari was the Atari Proline Joystick, and then after criticism which was received the European version came with 7800’s pro-line controllers.

To further the research in the Atari books like Replays the history of video games and the games explosion a history from pong to PlayStation are the sources which could contain useful information about the Atari.
